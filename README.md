# Fusion Extension : Map

### Extend Fusion with a Map Element.

The Map Element embeds a responsive map into the page.

There are 2 built in map types:

**Google Map Embed**

Allows you to use a Google Maps embed code to easily embed any map directly from Google.

**Google Map Custom**

Allows you to build a custom Google Map with a wide range of options for customizing the mapâ€™s positioning, type, controls, styles, and markers.

*This option uses the Google Maps JavaScript API and requires an [API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).*

**Requires the core [Fusion](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fusion/) plugin.**
